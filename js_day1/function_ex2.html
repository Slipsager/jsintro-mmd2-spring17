  <h1>The Age Calculator</h1>
  <p> Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!</p>
  <p>
  Write a function named calculateAge that:
  takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
  calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
  outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
  Call the function three times with different sets of values.
  Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.

  <strong> See results in the console </strong>

  <h1>What number's bigger?</h1>
  <p> Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!</p>
  <p>
  Write a function named greaterNum that:
  takes 2 arguments, both numbers.
  returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number.
  Call that function 2 times with different number pairs, and log the output to make sure it works (e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10.").
  </p>

  <strong> See results in the console </strong>

  <script>

  function greaterNum(number1, number2){
    var highest;
    if (number1 > number2){ highest = number1 }
    else if (number1 < number2) { highest = number2}
    //Output
    alert("The greater number of " + number1 + " and " + number2 + " is " + highest);

  }

// function calls
greaterNum(10, 20);
greaterNum(33, 20);
greaterNum(-6, 2);

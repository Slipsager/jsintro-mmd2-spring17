  <h1>The even/odd reporter</h1> Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20.
  For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen
  (e.g. "2 is even").

  <strong>See output in the console</strong>

  <script>

  for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    // i%2 displays rest
    if (i%2 === 0)
      console.log( i + " is even");
    else
      console.log( i + " is odd");
  }
  
  </script>

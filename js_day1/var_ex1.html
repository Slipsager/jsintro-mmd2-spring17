<h1>The Fortune Teller</h1>
<p>
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables:
number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
Output your fortune to the screen like so:
"You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
</p>
<script>
var numberOfChildren = 3;
var partner = "Scarlett Johanson";
var geoLocation = "New York";
var jobTitle = "DJ";

console.log("You will be a "+ jobTitle +" in " + geoLocation +" , and married to " + partner +" with "+ numberOfChildren + " kids.");


</script>
